# Conway's Game of Life

**Conway's Game of Life**, also known as **Life** is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway (rest in peace). It's a zero-player game, meaning that after creating the initial configuration, it requires no further input. It's a really interesting example of emergent behavious; based on a few simple rules, complex phenomena occurs. It's similar to us; we are more than the sum of the cells that compose us. Oh and fun fact, Life is Turing complete and someone has made a computer in the game (check links below).


### Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. 
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. 
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. 
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
